# Introduction
Testing some interesting concepts of functional programming in python

# Key concepts
 - Describe WHAT to do = Functional
 - Describing HOW to do = Imperative
 - Writing your code only using Functions are a good way to start

 1. No shared variables (global)
 2. Functions take parameters
 3. No variables instantiated inside functions

 - Instead of loops use states called recursively
 - All data changes are done with return values
