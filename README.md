# Introduction
 - Testing some interesting concepts of functional programming in python
 - Functional Programming do 3 things to your code:
    1. It gets easier to test
    2. It gets easier to reuse
    3. It gets easier to parallelize

# Key concepts
 - Describe WHAT to do = Functional
 - Describing HOW to do = Imperative
 - Writing your code only using Functions are a good way to start

 1. No shared variables (global)
 2. Functions take parameters
 3. No variables instantiated inside functions
 4. No variables store states: states are passed through return values
 5. Original variables do not change (no mutation)

 - Instead of loops use states called recursively
 - All data changes are done with return values
